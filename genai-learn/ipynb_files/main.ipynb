These models generate original outputs that are often indistinguishable from human-created content. These models use techniques like deep learning and neural networks to generate output.Unlike discriminative AI which focuses on classifying data into categories like spam vs. not spam, generative AI creates new data such as text, images, audio or video that resembles real-world examples.How Generative AI Works1. Core Mechanism (Training & Inference)Generative AI is trained on large datasets like text, images, audio or video using deep learning networks. During training, the model learns parameters (millions or billions of them) that help them predict or generate content. Here models generate output based on learned patterns and prompts provided2. By Media TypeText: Uses large language models (LLMs) to predict the next token in a sequence, enabling coherent paragraph or essay generation.Images: Diffusion models like DALL·E or Stable Diffusion start with noise and iteratively denoise to create realistic visualsSpeech: Text-to-speech models synthesize human-like voice by modeling acoustic features based on prompt.Video: Multimodal systems like Sora by OpenAI or Runway generate short, temporally coherent video clips from text or other prompts3. Agents in Generative AIModern systems often uses agents which are autonomous components that interact with the environment, obtain information and execute chains of tasks. These agents uses LLMs to reason, plan and act enabling workflows like querying databases, performing retrieval or controlling external APIs.4. Training and Fine-TuningLLMs are trained on massive general corpora (e.g., web text) using self-supervised methods. These models become pre-trained models which can be further trained on domain-specific labeled data to adapt to specialized tasks or stylistic needs. This technique is called fine tuning and it can be done using:LoRAQLoRAPeftReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)LLM Distilation5. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)Modern systems also uses RAG which enhances outputs by retrieving relevant documents at query time to ground the generation in accurate, up-to-date information, reducing hallucinations and improving factuality. The process typically involves:Indexing documents into embeddings stored in vector databasesRetrieval of relevant passagesAugmentation of the prompt with retrieved contentGeneration of grounded, informed responsesThis approach preserves the base model while enabling dynamic knowledge updatesTypes of Generative AI Models1. Transformers or Autoregressive ModelsTransformers or Autoregressive Models generate sequences by predicting the next token based on all previous ones moving step by step through the text.The architecture relies on the transformer’s self attention mechanism to capture context from the entire input so far making it highly effective for natural language and code generation.Popular examples include GPT models which can produce coherent, context aware paragraphs, solve coding tasks or answer complex queries.The autoregressive approach gives fine grained control over each output step but can be slower for long generations since tokens are generated one at a time.2. Diffusion ModelsDiffusion models generate data such as images or audio by starting with pure random noise and gradually refining it into a coherent output through a series of denoising steps.Each step reverses a simulated diffusion process that added noise to real data during training.This iterative approach can produce highly detailed and realistic results specially in image synthesis where models like Stable Diffusion and DALL·E 3 have set benchmarks.Diffusion models are also versatile they can be adapted for inpainting, style transfer and conditional generation from text prompts.3. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)VAEs and GANs were among the first deep learning architectures for generative tasks.A VAE encodes data into a compressed latent space and then decodes it back with a probabilistic twist that encourages smooth, continuous representations. This makes them good for controllable generation and interpolation between styles.GANs in contrast use two networks against each other a generator that tries to produce realistic outputs and a discriminator that tries to detect fakes.This adversarial setup leads to sharp, lifelike images though training can be unstable and prone to mode collapse.4. Encoder Decoder ModelsEncoder decoder architectures consist of two stages: the encoder processes the input into a dense representation and the decoder generates the desired output from that representation.They are widely used for sequence to sequence tasks like language translation, summarization and image captioning.The encoder captures the full context of the input before the decoder starts producing tokens, allowing for strong performance on tasks that require global understanding rather than token by token prediction.Modern encoder decoder models often use transformers for both stages as in T5, BART and many multimodal system.Evaluation of Generative AIEvaluating generative AI involves multiple dimensions because outputs can vary in accuracy, style and usefulness depending on the task. Key aspects include:Fact Accuracy and Hallucination Avoidance: Benchmarks like BEIR, Natural Questions assess factual correctness. Techniques like RAG and fine-tuning reduce hallucinations and ground responses in reliable data.Quality Metrics: Outputs are judged on fluency, coherence, logical consistency and contextual relevance. Commomly used metrics are BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, FID and IS.Efficiency and Accuracy Trade-Offs: LoRA and QLoRA helps in balancing performance with computational cost making models faster and lighter without losing quality.Resilience to Retrieval Noise: Advanced approaches like “Finetune-RAG” improve model accuracy by training the model to handle imperfect retrieval inputs hence increasing factual reliability.Creativity and Diversity: Models should generate varied and original outputs rather than repetitive or biased ones.Bias and Fairness: Evaluation includes checking whether outputs reflect harmful stereotypes or unfair treatment of groups. Tools like Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ) and StereoSet measure bias levels.User Experience and Usefulness: Beyond technical metrics, effectiveness is judged by how well the system supports users in real scenarios like chatbots providing relevant, actionable responses.Relationship Between Humans and Generative AIThe relationship between humans and generative AI is collaborative and evolving.Generative AI serves as a powerful tool that enhances human creativity, productivity and decision making by assisting in tasks like writing, designing, coding and problem solving.Rather than replacing humans it augments their abilities allowing people to work faster, explore new ideas and automate repetitive tasks.At the same time this relationship raises important questions around ethics, authorship and dependency emphasizing the need for thoughtful use and responsible development of AI technologies.Ultimately the synergy between human intuition and generative AI’s capabilities has the potential to transform how we create, communicate and innovate.Generative AI Vs AIHere is the comparison between Generative AI and AI:CriteriaGenerative AIArtificial Intelligence PurposeIt is designed to produce new content or dataDesigned for a wide range of tasks but not limited to generationApplication Art creation, text generation, video synthesis and so onData analysis, predictions, automation, robotics etcLearningUses Unsupervised learning or reinforcement learningCan use supervised, semi supervised or reinforcementOutcome New or original output is createdCan produce an answer and make a decision, classify, data etc.Complexity It requires a complex model like GANsIt has ranged from simple linear regression to complex neural networksData RequirementRequired a large amount of data to produce results of high quality dataData requirements may vary and some need little data and some need vast amountsApplications of Generative AIGenerative AI is applied in multiple domains like:Text: Powers chatbots, virtual assistants, content creation, document summarization and even code generation tools like GitHub Copilot.Images: Used in digital art, product design, fashion, advertising and medical imaging to create visuals that are close to real-world examples.Audio & Speech: Enables natural-sounding voice assistants, multilingual dubbing, music composition, personalized voice cloning and accessibility tools.Video: Supports animation, movie special effects, gaming, marketing videos and realistic training simulations.Business Use Cases: Enhances customer support with AI agents, boosts knowledge discovery using RAG systems, accelerates drug discovery, assists in financial forecasting and improves data-driven decision-making.AdvantagesAccelerates Research and Development: In fields like science and technology, Generative AI reduces the time needed for research by generating multiple outcomes and predictions such as molecular structures in drug development. This speeds up innovation and helps solve complex problems efficiently.Improves Personalization: Generative AI creates tailored content based on user preferences. From personalized product designs to customized marketing campaigns it enhances user engagement and satisfaction by delivering exactly what users need or want.Empowers Non Experts: Even users without expertise can create high quality content using Generative AI. This helps individuals learn new skills access creative tools and open doors to personal and professional growth.Drives Economic Growth: Generative AI introduces new roles and opportunities by fostering innovation, automating tasks and enhancing productivity. This leads to economic expansion and the creation of jobs in emerging fields.DisadvantagesData Dependence: The accuracy and quality of Generative AI outputs depend entirely on the data it is trained on. If the training data is biased, incomplete or inaccurate the generated content will reflect these flaws.Limited Control Over Outputs: It can produce unexpected or irrelevant results making it challenging to control the content and ensure it aligns with specific user requirements.High Computational Requirements: Training and running Generative AI models demand significant computing power which can be costly and resource intensive. This limits accessibility for smaller organizations or individuals.Ethical and Legal Concerns: It can be misused to create harmful content like deepfakes or fake news which can spread misinformation or violate privacy. These ethical and legal challenges require careful regulation and oversight to prevent abuse. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntroduction of Generative AI\\n\\n\\nVisit Course\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n        Comment\\r\\n    More info \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nanushka_jain_gfg \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Follow \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImprove\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArticle Tags : \\n\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence\\n\\n\\nAI-ML-DS\\n\\n\\nGenerative AI\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLike\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n945 interested Geeks \\n\\n\\n\\nGATE DA 2028 Online Course [Live Classes + Recorded] \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExplore\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1k+ interested Geeks \\n\\n\\n\\nGATE DA 2027 Online Course [Live Classes + Recorded] \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExplore\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1k+ interested Geeks \\n\\n\\n\\nGATE CSE + DA 2028 Live Course [with Placement Preparation] \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExplore\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCorporate & Communications Address:\\n\\r\\n                      A-143, 7th Floor, Sovereign Corporate Tower, Sector- 136, Noida, Uttar Pradesh (201305)                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRegistered Address:\\r\\n                        K 061, Tower K, Gulshan Vivante Apartment, Sector 137, Noida, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, 201305                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCompanyAbout UsLegalPrivacy PolicyCareersContact UsCorporate SolutionCampus Training ProgramExplorePOTDJob-A-ThonConnectCommunityBlogsNation Skill UpTutorialsProgramming LanguagesDSAWeb TechnologyAI, ML & Data ScienceDevOpsCS Core SubjectsInterview PreparationGATESchool SubjectsSoftware and ToolsCoursesIBM CertificationDSA and PlacementsWeb DevelopmentData ScienceProgramming LanguagesDevOps & CloudGATETrending TechnologiesOffline CentersNoidaBengaluruPuneHyderabadPatnaPreparation CornerAptitudePuzzlesGfG 160DSA 360System Design \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n@GeeksforGeeks, Sanchhaya Education Private Limited, All rights reserved\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImprovement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuggest changes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuggest Changes\\nHelp us improve.

Encoder Decoder ModelsEncoder decoder architectures consist of two stages: the encoder processes the input into a dense representation and the decoder generates the desired output from that representation.They are widely used for sequence to sequence tasks like language translation, summarization and image captioning.The encoder captures the full context of the input before the decoder starts producing tokens, allowing for strong performance on tasks that require global understanding rather than token by token prediction.Modern encoder decoder models often use transformers for both stages as in T5, BART and many multimodal system.Evaluation of Generative AIEvaluating generative AI involves multiple dimensions because outputs can vary in accuracy, style and usefulness depending on the task. Key aspects include:Fact Accuracy and Hallucination Avoidance: Benchmarks like BEIR, Natural Questions assess factual correctness. Techniques like RAG and fine-tuning reduce hallucinations and ground responses in reliable data.Quality Metrics: Outputs are judged on fluency, coherence, logical consistency and contextual relevance. Commomly used metrics are BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, FID and IS.Efficiency and Accuracy Trade-Offs: LoRA and QLoRA helps in balancing performance with computational cost making models faster and lighter without losing quality.Resilience to Retrieval Noise: Advanced approaches like “Finetune-RAG” improve model accuracy by training the model to handle imperfect retrieval inputs hence increasing factual reliability.Creativity and Diversity: Models should generate varied and original outputs rather than repetitive or biased ones.Bias and Fairness: Evaluation includes checking whether outputs reflect harmful stereotypes or unfair treatment of groups. Tools like Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ) and StereoSet measure bias levels.User Experience and Usefulness: Beyond technical metrics, effectiveness is judged by how well the system supports users in real scenarios like chatbots providing relevant, actionable responses.Relationship Between Humans and Generative AIThe relationship between humans and generative AI is collaborative and evolving.Generative AI serves as a powerful tool that enhances human creativity, productivity and decision making by assisting in tasks like writing, designing, coding and problem solving.Rather than replacing humans it augments their abilities allowing people to work faster, explore new ideas and'),\n",

       "'Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence designed to create new content such as text, images, music or even code by learning patterns from existing data. These models generate original outputs that are often indistinguishable from human-created content. These models use techniques like deep learning and neural networks to generate output.Unlike discriminative AI which focuses on classifying data into categories like spam vs. not spam, generative AI creates new data such as text, images, audio or video that resembles real-world examples.How Generative AI Works1. Core Mechanism (Training & Inference)Generative AI is trained on large datasets like text, images, audio or video using deep learning networks. During training, the model learns parameters (millions or billions of them) that help them predict or generate content. Here models generate output based on learned patterns and prompts provided2. By Media TypeText: Uses large language models (LLMs) to predict the next token in a sequence, enabling coherent paragraph or essay generation.Images: Diffusion models like DALL·E or Stable Diffusion start with noise and iteratively denoise to create realistic visualsSpeech: Text-to-speech models synthesize human-like voice by modeling acoustic features based on prompt.Video: Multimodal systems like Sora by OpenAI or Runway generate short, temporally coherent video clips from text or other prompts3. Agents in Generative AIModern systems often uses agents which are autonomous components that interact with the environment, obtain information and execute chains of tasks. These agents uses LLMs to reason, plan and act enabling workflows like querying databases, performing retrieval or controlling external APIs.4. Training and Fine-TuningLLMs are trained on massive general corpora (e.g., web text) using self-supervised methods. These models become pre-trained models which can be further trained on domain-specific labeled data to adapt to specialized tasks or stylistic needs. This technique is called fine tuning and it can be done using:LoRAQLoRAPeftReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)LLM Distilation5. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)Modern systems also uses RAG which enhances outputs by retrieving relevant documents at query time to ground the generation in accurate, up-to-date information, reducing hallucinations and improving factuality. The process typically involves:Indexing documents into embeddings stored in vector databasesRetrieval of'"
